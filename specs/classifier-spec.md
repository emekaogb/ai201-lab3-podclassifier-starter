# Classifier Spec — Pod Classifier

Complete this spec **before** writing any code for Milestone 2.

Use Plan or Ask mode to think through each blank field. When you're done,
your answers here become the blueprint for `build_few_shot_prompt()` and
`classify_episode()` in `classifier.py`.

---

## build_few_shot_prompt(labeled_examples, description)

### What it does
Constructs a prompt string for the LLM that includes the task instructions,
all labeled training examples, and the new episode description to classify.

### Inputs

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `labeled_examples` | `list[dict]` | Each dict has `"title"`, `"description"`, `"label"` (and others). These are the examples you labeled in Milestone 1. |
| `description` | `str` | The episode description to classify. |

### Output

| Return value | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| prompt | `str` | A complete prompt string ready to send to the LLM. |

---

### Spec fields — fill these in before writing code

**Task instruction (what should the LLM know about the task?):**

```
You are classifying podcast episodes by their format. Classify the episode
into exactly one of these four labels:

- interview: a conversation between a host and one or more guests
- solo: a single host speaking from memory, experience, or opinion — no guests,
  no assembled external sources
- panel: multiple guests with roughly equal speaking time, often debating or
  discussing a topic together
- narrative: a story assembled from external sources — interviews, archival
  audio, reporting — with a clear narrative arc

Return only the label and your reasoning. Do not explain the taxonomy.
```

---

**How should labeled examples be formatted in the prompt?**

```
Each example should include the episode title, a brief excerpt or the full
description, and the correct label. Separate examples with a blank line or
a delimiter like "---". Include all fields that help the model see why the
label was applied — title and description are both useful; other fields
(like episode ID) are not needed.
```

**Example block sketch (write one concrete example):**

```
Title: Dr. Priya Nair on the Science of Sleep Deprivation

Description: Dr. Priya Nair has spent fifteen years studying what happens to the brain when it doesn't sleep. In this episode, we talk through her landmark 2019 study on cumulative sleep debt, what the research says about weekend recovery sleep (spoiler: it doesn't work the way you think), and why she believes the eight-hour standard is more cultural myth than biological fact. She also shares what changed in her own sleep habits after spending a decade measuring everyone else's. If you've ever felt fine on five hours, this conversation will make you rethink that confidence.

Label: Interview
```

---

**How should the new episode (to be classified) be presented?**

```
Title: {title}
Description: {description}
Label: ?

Classify the episode above. Return your answer in
the format below:

"Label: {label}
Reasoning: {reasoning}"
```

---

**What output format should you request from the LLM?**

```
"Label: {label}
Reasoning: {reasoning}"
```

---

**Edge cases to handle in the prompt:**

```
[blank — what if labeled_examples is empty? What if the description is very
short? How does your prompt handle these?]

If labeled_examples is empty, respond that there's no labeled examples.
If the description is very short, use the best guess but warn the user that the description is too short.
```

---

## classify_episode(description, labeled_examples)

### What it does
Classifies a single podcast episode description using the few-shot LLM classifier.
Returns a dict with a label and reasoning.

### Inputs

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `description` | `str` | The episode description to classify. |
| `labeled_examples` | `list[dict]` | Labeled training examples from `load_labeled_examples()`. |

### Output

| Return value | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| result | `dict` | Must have keys `"label"` and `"reasoning"`. `"label"` must be one of `VALID_LABELS` or `"unknown"`. |

---

### Spec fields — fill these in before writing code

**Step 1 — Build the prompt:**

```
Call build_few_shot_prompt(labeled_examples, description) and store the
returned string in a variable (e.g., prompt). Pass through both arguments
exactly as received — no modification needed before calling.
```

---

**Step 2 — Send to the LLM:**

```
Call _client.chat.completions.create() with:
  - model: the model name from config (LLM_MODEL)
  - messages: a list with one dict — {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
    (system-design.md shows an optional system message too — either shape works)
  - max_tokens: a reasonable limit (e.g., 200–300) to keep responses concise

Extract the response text from:
  response.choices[0].message.content
```

---

**Step 3 — Parse the response:**

```
Extract label from the string after "Label: " and reasoning from the string after "Reasoning: ". Use Regex operations to parse through the string.
```

---

**Step 4 — Validate the label:**

```
If the label isn't in valid labels, set it to unknown.
```

---

**Step 5 — Handle errors gracefully:**

```
[blank — what could go wrong? (Network error? Unparseable response?)
What should the function return if something fails?
Hint: the evaluation loop runs 20 calls — one bad response shouldn't crash everything.]
```

---

### Return value structure

```python
{
    "label": str,      # one of VALID_LABELS, or "unknown" if invalid/error
    "reasoning": str,  # brief explanation from the LLM
}
```

---

## Notes on label quality

The classifier is only as good as your labels. If your training examples have
inconsistent or ambiguous labels, the LLM will learn the wrong pattern.

Before implementing the classifier, re-read `data/taxonomy.md` and double-check
any labels you're unsure about. Annotation quality is part of the lab.

## Implementation Notes

*Fill this in after implementing and testing both functions.*

**Test: what does the raw LLM response look like for one episode?**

```
Episode tested: [title]
Raw response text: [paste it here]
```

**How did you parse the label out of the response?**

```
[describe the string operations — strip, split, lower, etc.]
```

**Did any episodes return `"unknown"`? If so, why?**

```
[yes / no — if yes, what did the raw response look like?]
```

**One thing about the output format that surprised you:**

```
[your answer here]
